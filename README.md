# HttPete

HttPete is a powerful, cross-platform API client designed to make documentation a first-class citizen in your API workflows. Built with developers in mind, HttPete streamlines the way you document, test, and manage APIs by integrating essential tools into a single, seamless interface.

## Features

### üöÄ Built for Developers
- **Local-First Approach**: No logins or cloud dependencies‚Äîyour data stays on your machine.
- **Open Source**: HttPete is open-source software (MIT license) designed to grow with the developer community.

### üìã Documentation as a First-Class Citizen
- **Endpoint-Specific Documentation**: Import OpenAPI specifications or Postman collections to generate endpoint-specific markdown documentation.
- **Custom Documentation**: Create non-endpoint-related documentation to capture functional or business logic.
- **Static HTML Export**: Export your documentation as static HTML that can be easily deployed anywhere.

### üõ†Ô∏è API Testing Made Easy
- **Integrated API Client**: Test endpoints directly within HttPete to validate functionality and performance.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Keep your API documentation synchronized with the latest changes.

### üåç Collaborative and Flexible
- **Markdown Support**: Write and maintain documentation in markdown for simplicity and portability.
- **Version Control Friendly**: Designed to integrate seamlessly into Git-based workflows.

## Why HttPete?

Existing tools like Postman and Bruno are excellent for API testing but often fall short when it comes to integrating documentation into the workflow. HttPete bridges this gap by enabling developers to:

- Document APIs as they work.
- Share documentation effortlessly with teams.
- Reduce context switching between tools.
