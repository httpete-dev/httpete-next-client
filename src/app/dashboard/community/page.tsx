This guide will walk you through the basics of using our platform for API testing and documentation.\n\n## Setting up your first project\n\n1. Log in to your HttPete account\n2. Click on "New Project" in the dashboard\n3. Give your project a name and description\n4. Start adding API endpoints\n\n## Creating your first API test\n\n1. In your project, click "New Test"\n2. Enter the API endpoint URL\n3. Select the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.)\n4. Add any necessary headers or parameters\n5. Click "Send" to run the test\n\n## Documenting your API\n\n1. After running a successful test, click "Generate Docs"\n2. HttPete will automatically create a documentation template\n3. Edit the generated content to add more details\n4. Use markdown to format your documentation\n\nCongratulations! You\'ve now created your first API test and documentation in HttPete. Explore more features to get the most out of our platform.' },
    { id: 2, title: 'Advanced API Testing Techniques', content: '# Advanced API Testing Techniques\n\nThis guide covers advanced techniques for API testing in HttPete.\n\n## Using environment variables\n\nEnvironment variables allow you to reuse values across multiple tests.\n\n1. Go to "Environment Settings"\n2. Add key-value pairs for your variables\n3. Use `{{variable_name}}` in your tests to reference these variables\n\n## Chaining API requests\n\nYou can use the response from one API call in subsequent requests.\n\n1. Create a new test\n2. In the "Pre-request Script" tab, add code to extract data from a previous response\n3. Use this data in your current request\n\n## Writing test scripts\n\nTest scripts allow you to automate assertions on your API responses.\n\n1. In the "Tests" tab of your request\n2. Write JavaScript to assert expected values\n3. Use the `pm` object to access response data and make assertions\n\nExample:\n```javascript\npm.test("Status code is 200", function () {\n    pm.response.to.have.status(200);\n});\n```\n\nMaster these techniques to become an API testing expert with HttPete!' },

Wrote pre-request scripts to handle authentication\n4. Used test scripts to automate assertions\n5. Set up monitors to run tests periodically\n6. Used the documentation generation feature to keep docs up-to-date\n\nNow, whenever I make changes, I just run my HttPete collection, and it takes care of testing and updating the documentation.
